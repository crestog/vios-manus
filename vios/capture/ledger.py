"""
vios.capture.ledger — the permanent record of what has been captured.

This is the single most important file in the capture plane, because it is the
only thing that is not regenerable. Everything else — the queue, the temp
files, the running process, the Kaggle session — is disposable. The ledger is
the answer to "have I already got this reel?", and it has to keep answering
that correctly after the notebook dies, after the account is rotated, after
six months and a new laptop.

Three properties it must have, and how each is bought:

  Durable across a process kill.
      WAL journal, `synchronous=FULL`, and one commit per item. A row is
      written *before* the fetch begins (state `fetching`) and updated after
      the upload returns, so a hard kill leaves evidence that work started —
      which the next run repairs rather than repeats blindly.

  Durable across the machine vanishing.
      Kaggle deletes everything. So the ledger is snapshotted to the Telegram
      channel as a document every `SNAPSHOT_EVERY` items, and `restore()`
      pulls the newest snapshot back before a run begins. Telegram is the
      permanent store for the archive; it is the permanent store for the
      bookkeeping too.

  Durable even if both of those are lost.
      The channel itself is the ground truth: every uploaded video carries its
      permalink in the caption. `vios.capture.seed` walks the channel and
      rebuilds the ledger from those captions. That is how the 552 reels
      captured by the old Colab script are adopted without re-downloading a
      single byte.

The key is the Instagram shortcode, not the URL, because the same reel reaches
us as /reel/, /reels/, /p/ and /tv/ with and without query strings, and from
several collections at once.
