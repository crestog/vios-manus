vios.capture.fetch — one permalink in, one complete evidence bundle out.

The old Colab script asked yt-dlp for a video and an info JSON. That threw away
the single richest signal Instagram hands out for free: **the comments**. For a
system whose stated purpose is understanding why a reel worked, the audience's
own reaction is not a nice-to-have — it is the only ground truth about
reception that exists anywhere in the pipeline. yt-dlp's Instagram extractor
has a dedicated comments endpoint and fetching it costs exactly one extra HTTP
request per reel, which at our pacing is free.

So this module extracts the maximum, once, and never comes back:

  video      the original mp4, untouched, never re-encoded
  info json  yt-dlp's metadata with --no-clean-info-json, so the raw Instagram
             API fields survive rather than being pruned to the fields yt-dlp
             itself models
  comments   --write-comments: author, text, like count, and parent id, which
             is what gives the reply threading
  thumbnail  the creator's own chosen cover frame — an authored artifact, not
             a frame we picked
  record     a normalised, schema-versioned summary written by us on top of all
             of the above, so the processing plane never has to guess which of
             Instagram's several view-count fields is populated today

Everything lands in one temp directory per reel and is uploaded together.

Failure taxonomy matters here, because the pacer's reaction depends on it:

  unavailable  the post is gone or private. Terminal — nothing retries.
  hostile      401/429/checkpoint/login-required. Back off hard; this is the
               response that precedes a block.
  transient    network, timeout, a bad minute. Retry later at the same pace.

Conflating the last two is the mistake that turns a rate limit into a ban:
retrying a 429 promptly is precisely the behaviour being watched for.

Invocation is `python -m yt_dlp`, not the `yt-dlp` console script. On Kaggle a
`pip install --user` puts the script somewhere off PATH often enough that the
console-script form fails intermittently on a machine where the module imports
perfectly — and an intermittent failure in an unattended week-long run is much
worse than an obvious one.
