"""
Per-video asset sets: what gets uploaded alongside the mp4, and why.

The channel already holds one message per video. That is enough to *have* the
archive and not nearly enough to *use* it: Atlas can only read a video's bytes
through an MTProto media session, which needs a login, costs an auth handshake,
and is metered by a handful of permits. Playing a moment somebody searched for
means opening one of those sessions, seeking a 1 MiB chunk boundary, and hoping
the mp4's moov atom is at the front. Hovering a search result to preview it
means doing that again, for every result on the page.

So each video gets an *asset set* threaded under its message:

    <key>.mp4                 the video            (already there)
    <key>.json                metadata, merged with the Instagram export slice
    <key>-chunk-0000.mp4 …    2-second standalone clips, in order
    <key>-manifest.json       the index over all of the above

The clips are the point. `ffmpeg -f segment -c copy` is a demux/remux, not a
transcode — it costs I/O, not GPU, and it cuts on keyframes so every clip is
independently decodable. A 2-second vertical reel clip is ~150–400 KB, which is
two orders of magnitude under the Bot API's 20 MB `getFile` ceiling. That is the
whole optimisation: **a clip is reachable over plain HTTPS with nothing but the
bot token.** No session, no login, no permit. Atlas asking "show me 12.4 s of
this video" becomes one HTTP GET of a small file.

A correction to the earlier design, recorded here because it is the kind of
thing that reads as true until it is tested: a segment is **not** a byte slice
of the original file. `-c copy` writes a fresh mp4 container per segment, with
its own `ftyp` and `moov`, so the sample payload matches but nothing else does
and the byte offsets do not line up. A manifest mapping original byte ranges to
segments would be wrong at every entry. Clips are therefore indexed by **time**,
the way HLS does it, and byte-range playback of the whole file keeps using the
existing sparse-chunk path (with a new whole-file HTTP shortcut, which covers
nearly every reel — see `atlas/media.http_pull`).

What the clips buy, concretely:

  * hovering a search result plays the matched moment, immediately, without
    downloading the video
  * a poster frame can be extracted at *any* timestamp for a video that has
    never been downloaded — fetch the one clip that covers it, decode a frame
  * seeking to a moment costs one small file instead of a media session

`<key>-frames.tar.zst` is built only when `VIOS_UPLOAD_FRAMES=1`. Nothing in
Atlas reads raw frames — it reads video, clips, evidence, manifest and
metadata — and the analysis tier for one reel is tens of MB compressed. Across
hundreds of videos that would dominate every capture run to feed a consumer
that does not exist. The builder is here and works; the default is off, and
that is a deliberate choice rather than an omission.
