vios.capture.inputs — turn whatever the user has into a permalink queue.

Two front doors, because the user has both:

  1. The Instagram data export ZIP. Requested from Accounts Center, arrives as
     a ZIP of JSON (or HTML) files. `saved_posts.json` /
     `saved_collections.json` hold the saved reels, and the collection name is
     the thing worth preserving — it is the only human categorisation in the
     entire pipeline and it is free.

  2. A markdown file of the shape the old Colab script read: `## Category`
     headers followed by permalinks. Hand-maintained, so it must tolerate
     anything — links inline in prose, links in bullet lists, duplicate
     headers, links before the first header.

Both produce the same thing: an ordered list of (url, collection) pairs. The
ledger deduplicates, so the two inputs can be imported over each other.

The export's JSON layout has changed shape several times and Meta does not
document it. Rather than pattern-match one version, this walks the decoded
JSON generically and pulls every Instagram permalink it finds, attributing it
to the nearest enclosing name-ish key. That is robust to a rename of
`saved_saved_media` (which has happened) and to the HTML export, which is
parsed by the same permalink regex over raw text.
