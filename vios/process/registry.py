"""
vios.process.registry — every model and script declared as data.

This file is the answer to "what is actually running?". Nothing here executes.
Each component is a row: what it needs, what it costs, what it produces, what it
depends on. The rotation loop reads these rows to decide what to load; the
interface reads the same rows to draw the list of systems. There is exactly one
description of the pipeline and both the machine and the person read it.

Why data and not code:

  A pipeline written as a function is a pipeline you cannot look at. You cannot
  ask it "what would fit in 14 GB?", you cannot show it in a table, and you
  cannot add a model to it without editing control flow. A pipeline written as a
  list of rows answers all three by inspection.

Four rules govern what goes in this list.

**Mathematics before models.** Cut rate, loudness, colour, motion, tempo and
shot scale are computed, not asked. A model that is asked "how fast is this
cut?" produces a plausible sentence; `numpy.diff` over the shot table produces
the number. Nine of the components below never load a neural network at all, and
they carry the parts of the database that must be exactly right.

**Time is never claimed.** Every component that speaks about *when* speaks in
shot indices. The shot table maps an index to seconds by arithmetic we control.
No prompt anywhere in this system asks a model for a timestamp, because models
produce timestamps that look correct and are not.

**Two observers where it matters.** Speech, on-screen text and meaning each get
a second, architecturally different reader. Agreement is a confidence signal;
disagreement is a flag worth surfacing. This is the schema-level form of "i dont
trust one single llm, or model, or script".

**Sized for the machine that exists.** Every VRAM figure assumes Kaggle's 2 × T4:
Turing, SM 75, 16 GB per card, no NVLink. That means FP16 or INT4 (AWQ/GPTQ),
never BF16, never FP8, never FlashAttention-2 — see `resources.capabilities`.
Anything needing more than one card says so and is off by default.
