vios.process.runners.base — the shape every pass has, and the model cache.

A runner is one function:

    def run(job: Job) -> Emission

It reads from `job`, returns claims and vectors, and writes nothing to the
database itself. The store stays the only writer, which is what makes a failed
pass leave no half-written evidence behind — an exception three quarters of the
way through a runner discards the whole emission, and the coverage row goes back
to queued with nothing to clean up.

Two ideas carry most of the weight here.

**The model cache is keyed by weights, not by component.** `describe`, `narrate`
and `style-read` are three passes over one 8 GB VLM. Loading it three times
would not fit and loading it per video would spend more time on `from_pretrained`
than on inference. The cache holds it for the whole cohort and the engine drops
it when the cohort ends.

**Indices are the only currency for time.** `Job.shot_at()` converts seconds to
a shot index and `Job.all_frames()` hands out frame indices already dated from
the container's own presentation timestamps. Nothing converts an index back
except the store. A runner that wants to say "at 4.2 seconds" physically cannot
— the claim it builds carries an index, and the store derives t0/t1 itself.

**A pass sees every frame, or says why not.** `Job.frames()` is the old
one-keyframe-per-shot view and remains for the passes that genuinely summarise a
shot. `Job.all_frames()` / `Job.frame_batches()` are the complete set that
`structure.allframes` extracted and proved, and they are what the perception
passes read: a reel is judged on all nine hundred of its frames, not on thirty
of them. Missing frames are reported through `job.note`, never quietly dropped,
because a pass that reads 812 of 900 frames and reports success is the failure
this design exists to remove.
