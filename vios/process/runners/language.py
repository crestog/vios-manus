"""
vios.process.runners.language — the only passes that are asked what it means.

Everything before this stage measures. This stage interprets, which is where a
database stops being trustworthy unless the interpretation is constrained. Three
constraints do that work here, and they are structural rather than
prompt-shaped:

**Shot indices, never timestamps.** A model is handed keyframes labelled `shot
4` and answers about shot 4. It is never shown a clock and never asked for one,
so it cannot produce `00:07` — and a returned index outside the range it was
given is dropped rather than stored. Every timestamp in the finished database
comes from the shot table.

**Grounding before interpretation.** `narrate` and `style-read` read the
transcript, the on-screen text, the shot descriptions and the numbers the signal
passes computed. They are asked to explain measurements that already exist,
not to invent observations.

**A control group.** `concepts` is scored against `keyphrase`, which is
statistical and cannot invent a phrase. A concept neither the extractor nor the
source text supports is still stored — it is evidence about the model — but it
is marked unsupported and does not become a graph node.

    "i dont trust one single llm, or model, or script, but if there are
     multiple systems and combination of things working for each elements ...
     then and only then it will be able to satisfy the quality requirements"
