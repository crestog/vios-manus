"""
vios.process.runners.vision — what is on the screen, in every frame of it.

Eight passes over the **complete** frame set, and they are deliberately
redundant. Two OCR engines read the same pixels because a detector-plus-
recogniser drops stylised type while an end-to-end vision-language model invents
plausible words, and the two failures do not overlap. Two embedding towers index
the same frames because SigLIP and CLIP retrieve differently, so a moment found
by either is found. Objects come from a closed vocabulary with boxes, faces from
a geometric detector, scale from a depth model.

These passes used to read `frames/index.json` — one keyframe per shot. A
900-frame reel was judged on about thirty images, which is why a caption that
appeared for two seconds between cuts existed nowhere in the database. They now
read `allframes`, which the structure stage already extracted and *proved*
complete, and every frame goes through every model that wants pixels.

Total coverage is affordable because of two things and not because anything is
skipped:

  batching     a T4 costs roughly the same for one image as for thirty-two, so
               a 900-frame reel is ~28 forward passes, not 900
  run-length   identical consecutive readings collapse into one row spanning
               `frame_idx…frame_hi`. "SUBSCRIBE was on screen for frames
               100–142" is one row that still answers "what was on screen at
               frame 117" exactly. Per-frame numbers go to packed columnar
               arrays instead of a row each

Nothing here is asked for a timestamp. Every claim carries the frame index and
the time the extractor read out of the container's presentation timestamps; the
store derives the shot. A model's opinion about when something happened is not
evidence, and this is the layer where that rule is enforced by construction.
