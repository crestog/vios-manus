vios.process.runners.audio — speech, speakers, and the sound that is not speech.

Four passes over one waveform, and they disagree on purpose. Two transcribers
read the same audio with different decoders so that agreement between them can
be measured instead of assumed; a diarizer says how many voices there are
without saying whose; and a tagger reads everything the transcript throws away,
which on short-form video is about half the craft.

The archive is English, Hindi, Hinglish and a long southern tail, so language is
detected per video and never assumed. A pass that assumes English does not fail
on Telugu — it succeeds, fluently, at producing nonsense, and nothing downstream
can tell. Low-confidence detections are flagged as claims rather than silently
transcribed, which is the user's rule:

    "if its not able to process then it can report to me, we can improve later"

    Zero-shot again, and for the same reason as the visual tagger — the answer

    invented.

    The grid is the point. This pass used to score one ten-second window per
    ten seconds and attribute the result to a shot, which answered "there was
    applause somewhere in this shot" — a sentence that cannot place a moment.
    It now scores `job.audio_grid()`: 0.96 s windows on a 0.48 s hop, covering
    `[0, duration)` with no gaps, which is the audio equivalent of "every
    frame". 0.96 s is also what CLAP was trained to ingest, so each window is
    one whole model input rather than a slice of one.

    Two things come out of that. Every class gets a per-window score series
    stored as a packed `frame_metric` array — the numbers, at full resolution,
    for anything that wants to threshold them differently later. And every
    class that stays above threshold across consecutive windows becomes one
    run-length claim carrying the *frame* index of its span, so a sound and a
