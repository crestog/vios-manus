vios.process.engine — the rotation loop.

The user described this system before any of it existed, and the description is
worth keeping in front of the code:

    "available resources (2 gpu of 15 gb ram 30 gb, 57 gb disk) it loads few
     models according to resources, then use those models to process all
     videos, save in database and uploads into permanent storage... then it
     deletes those models and load next modles and scripts analyzes all videos
     and upload its database to permanent storage and the loop continues, till
     all the videos are processed and entire database is completed"

That is exactly what happens here, and the ordering it implies is the one
non-obvious decision in the file. There are two ways to sweep thirty passes
over five thousand videos:

    pass-major     for each component: for each video: run it
    cohort-major   for each cohort:    for each video: run every resident pass

Pass-major is simpler and wrong. The source mp4 lives in Telegram, not on disk,
so every pass would re-download and re-decode the same reel — thirty times,
five thousand times over. Cohort-major downloads once, decodes once, and runs
every pass that is already in VRAM before moving on. The cost is a cache of
working directories on scratch disk, which is bounded and evicted; the saving
is roughly twenty-nine downloads per video.

Everything else follows from three facts about where this runs:

**A Kaggle session is killed at twelve hours, without warning.** So progress is
durable after every single pass, not at the end of a cohort — the coverage
table is written before the next pass starts. A session that dies mid-cohort
loses at most the pass that was running.

**Ten accounts run this concurrently and cannot talk to each other.** So the
worker takes a static partition and never looks outside it, and publishes its
findings as append-only shards that any other worker can replay.

**Nothing here owns the archive.** The mp4s belong to the channel and the
evidence belongs to the shards. This process is disposable; if it burns down
mid-sweep, the next one re-reads the shards and continues.

        The user's question was "will this export work automatically, and
        perfectly, after each video is processed?" — and the honest answer for
        the previous build was no: `PUBLISH_EVERY = 50` meant a session could
        run for hours and be killed with everything still local. Publishing on
        every video is the right default because a video is the unit of work
        that is either wholly done or not done at all. The two clocks are what
        keep that from degenerating: the floor stops a fast cohort from filling
        the channel with tiny files, and the ceiling makes sure a slow one still
        checkpoints, so the maximum loss is bounded by time rather than by how
        many reels happened to fit in a cohort.

        Runs after a restore and again at the top of every sweep. Without it a
        fresh container replays five thousand videos' worth of shards into the
        evidence tables, opens an empty coverage table beside them, and
        processes the entire archive a second time — which is the "it
        reprocesses everything" complaint exactly.

        Two different questions, answered two different ways, and the split is
        the whole design:

        **A pass that writes evidence is judged only on its own evidence**,
        keyed on `observer_id`. A revision bump is how a pass says "the old
        reading is superseded"; matching on the component alone would let the
        superseded reading satisfy the new one and silently cancel the upgrade
        the bump was for.

        **A pass that writes no evidence is inferred from its dependants.**
        `probe`, `artifacts`, `shots`, `keyframes` and `allframes` produce
        working files, not rows — a restored database holds no trace of them,
        so an evidence check would leave all five queued for every video in the
        archive and the sweep would download five thousand videos to rebuild
        frames nothing is waiting for. But if `ocr` has claims for a video from
        the current observer, then `allframes` demonstrably ran for that video:
        the dependency edge is the proof. Their outputs are rebuilt on demand
        by `_ensure_inputs` the moment a pass actually needs them, which is the
        same guarantee that already lets cohort 1 run after cohort 0's workdir
        was evicted.

        The inference is applied *only* to passes that write nothing. Closing
        the dependency graph over evidence-writing passes would be the exact
        inversion described above — `tag` at an unchanged revision would mark a
        freshly bumped `visual-embed` as done — so it is deliberately not done.
