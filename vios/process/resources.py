"""
vios.process.resources — what this machine actually has, measured now.

The rotation loop's first question is "what fits?", and the honest answer
changes between sessions. Kaggle hands out 2×T4 most of the time and a P100
sometimes; a notebook that has already loaded something has less free VRAM than
one that just started; the 57 GB scratch disk is 57 GB until someone caches a
model into it. So nothing here is read from a config file. Everything is probed.

Three sources, in order of preference:

  torch          authoritative, but only present in the GPU session
  nvidia-smi     present whenever a driver is, and works without torch
  nothing        CPU-only, which is a legitimate mode: the signal passes,
                 ffmpeg artifacts and shot detection all run fine without a GPU

The web UI imports this module, and the web UI often runs where torch does not
exist. Every probe therefore degrades to a blank rather than an exception.
