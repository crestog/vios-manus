vios.process.intake — where the videos come from, and how they get here.

The processing plane owns no bytes. Every original mp4 lives in the Telegram
channel, put there by the capture plane, and the evidence store holds a
`video_key` and a message id. So before any pass can run, three things have to
happen, and this module is all three:

  sync      the capture ledger's finished rows become video rows in the
            evidence store — the list of what there is to process
  Source    one video's mp4 and its capture record land in a working directory
  restore   a fresh Kaggle session pulls back every evidence shard the channel
            already holds, so processing resumes instead of restarting

Two transports, and the choice between them is not stylistic. The Bot API can
download a file by `file_id` and is the simpler path, but it refuses anything
over 20 MB and it cannot fetch a message by id at all — which rules it out for
the record documents, whose file ids were never recorded for the 552 reels the
old Colab script uploaded. MTProto can do both. So MTProto is the primary path
and the Bot API is the fallback, which is the reverse of the capture plane's
arrangement and correct for the same underlying reason: capture writes small
files and knows their ids, processing reads arbitrary files and knows only
where they sit in the channel.

The MTProto session is opened once and held for the length of a sweep. Five
thousand videos through a per-download handshake would spend more time
connecting than transferring, and would look far more like a script than a
client.
