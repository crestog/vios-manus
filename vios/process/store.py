vios.process.store — the evidence store. Claims, not facts.

The v1 database recorded conclusions: one transcript, one description, one
answer. That is fine right up until two models disagree, at which point the
schema has nowhere to put the disagreement and the second answer overwrites the
first. Disagreement is the most informative thing this system can observe — it
is precisely where a single model would have quietly been wrong — so it needs a
place to live.

Hence: **every row is a claim, attributed to an observer.**

    "a person is holding a knife"     ← claimed by qwen3vl-8b-awq@a1b2, conf 0.81
    "a person is holding a phone"     ← claimed by internvl3-8b@c3d4,   conf 0.74

Both are kept. Nothing merges them. The reader — the interface, the search
index, the report writer — decides what to do with two claims about the same
shot, and it can do that because it can see who said what and how sure they
were. A `fact` table would have thrown the second one away at write time,
before anyone could look.

Three structural decisions follow from that:

**Append-only.** Claims are inserted, never updated. Re-running a model produces
a new observer id and a new set of rows; the old ones stay. This is what makes
"process it again with a better model" safe.

**Deterministic uid.** Every claim's uid is a hash of
(video, observer, channel, kind, shot, ordinal). Re-inserting the same claim is
a no-op via `INSERT OR IGNORE`, which is what makes shard replay idempotent —
and shard replay is how a fresh Kaggle session rebuilds this database from
Telegram in a couple of minutes.

**Time is derived, never claimed.** A claim carries a `shot_idx`; `t0`/`t1` are
filled in from the shot table by this module. A model that emits "at 4.2
seconds" is making a number up — MLLMs hallucinate temporal localisation badly
and confidently — so the schema does not offer it the opportunity. Models emit
shot indices; arithmetic turns those into seconds.

**A frame is addressable, and a run of frames is one row.** A shot is the right
unit for "what is this scene about"; it is far too coarse for "find the moment
the price appeared on screen". So a claim may also carry `frame_idx` — and
`frame_hi`, which turns *frames 100 through 142 all read "SUBSCRIBE"* into a
single row that is still answerable per frame with
`frame_idx <= ? AND frame_hi >= ?`. Coverage stays total; storage is
run-length. The frame timestamp still comes from the extractor's manifest,
which reads the container's presentation timestamps, so time remains measured
rather than claimed.

Per-frame embeddings and per-frame scalars do not go in `claim` or `vector` at
all. 900 frames × 1152 dimensions as 900 rows is a row-store answering a
column-store question; instead `frame_vector` and `frame_metric` hold one row
per (video, space, observer) with the frame indices and the values as packed
blobs. One reel of SigLIP is one row of about 1.4 MB.

        replayable. Wall-clock is not — a session whose clock is wrong, or that
        runs across a DST boundary, would skip or duplicate rows.

        Why JSONL and not a copy of the .db: shards are *merged* on restore,
        from ten different accounts that each processed a different partition.
        Merging ten SQLite files means attaching and inserting anyway; JSONL
        skips the step and compresses better.

        Every table carries its **own** id range. An embedding pass writes
        vectors and no claims at all, so keying the vector export off the claim
        range would silently drop every embedding the cohort produced — and it
        would look like a successful upload. The same trap applies twice more
