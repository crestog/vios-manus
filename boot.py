VIOS Boot Orchestrator — Master Control Plane

Phases:
  1. Pre-flight Sweep: Kill zombie processes from previous crashes
  2. Message Broker: Boot Redis in-memory (no AOF — Kaggle sessions are ephemeral,
     and a committed AOF file previously corrupted the boot; see .gitattributes)
  3. Session Init: Detect fresh session vs crash recovery
  4. Ignition: Launch all worker processes with auto-healing watchdog threads
