"""
lake.db schema — one definition, callable from any process.

Every table in lake.db used to be created by whichever process happened to
need it first: `posts`/`creators`/`categories` by ui_server at __main__,
`videos` by frame_worker on its first write, the analysis tables by
model_manager at warm-up. That works while the file only ever grows.

It stops working the moment the file is deleted. A factory reset removes
lake.db while ui_server is still running — ui_server is the process running
the reset, so it is deliberately not restarted, and nothing calls its
init_db() again. The harvester's next INSERT then hits "no such table: posts"
and keeps hitting it until the whole container is rebooted.

So the schema lives here instead, and the reset re-applies it the moment the
file is gone. Everything is CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS: calling this against a
populated database is a no-op, which is what lets the reset call it blindly.

# them, so an older file migrates and a fresh one is already correct.
