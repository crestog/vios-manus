"""
The Atlas server.

A single FastAPI app with one job: answer questions about the imported database
fast enough that the interface feels local.

Three decisions shape the whole file.

**Connections are per-thread, not per-request.** SQLite objects cannot cross
threads, and FastAPI runs `def` handlers in a worker pool. A thread-local
connection is opened once per worker and reused for the life of the process, so
a search costs no connection setup and keeps its 64 MB page cache warm across
requests. That cache being warm is a large part of why the second search feels
instant.

**Boot is asynchronous and the site is up during it.** The app starts serving
before the channel has been scanned, before the index is built and before the
encoder has loaded. Everything reports its own progress through `/api/status`,
and the interface renders whatever is ready. The alternative — block until the
channel is fully imported — means a blank browser tab for several minutes.

**No handler names a table.** Everything about the shape of the data comes from
`reflect`, so a bundle with new columns is browsable, searchable and displayable
without touching this file.

    The old design waited for the whole file. A 30 MB reel takes several seconds

    a 503 — the browser's `<video>` element treats that as a hard failure and
    stops, which is exactly what "the videos are not playing" looked like.

    So nothing waits for a whole file any more. Three tiers, cheapest first:

    1. **On disk.** Harvested locally or cached from an earlier watch. Ordinary
       range serving, no network.
    2. **In the sparse file.** A previous watch already pulled the chunks this
       range needs, even though the rest of the video is still missing. Scrubbing
       backwards and re-opening a video therefore cost nothing.
    3. **Straight from the channel.** `stream_remote` starts at the 1 MiB chunk
       holding the first requested byte and yields it onward as it arrives, so
       the first frame appears after one chunk instead of after the file. Chunks
       are written into the sparse file on the way past, which is how tier 2
       fills in, and a video watched to the end promotes itself into the cache.

    Only when MTProto is unavailable — bot-only credentials, a dead session —
    does this fall back to the old blocking download, because the HTTP Bot API
    cannot stream and 20 MB is all it will hand over.
