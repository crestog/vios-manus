"""
atlas.maps — the whole archive as one picture.

Three maps, built from what the database already holds, all of them clickable
down to the claim that produced the point.

  * **Semantic map** — every passage embedding projected to two dimensions.
    Distance on screen approximates distance in meaning, so the archive's
    actual shape becomes visible: the tight knot of gym reels, the long tail of
    one-off cooking clips, the bridge of videos that talk about both.
  * **Cluster map** — the same projection, coloured by k-means, with each
    cluster *named* from the words that distinguish its members. This is the
    part that answers "what is even in here" without anyone typing a query.
  * **Scatter plot** — any two numeric columns against each other, with the
    axis list derived from the schema rather than written here. Duration
    against likes, moment count against duration, cut rate against engagement:
    whatever the imported bundle happens to carry.

Why the projection is stored, not computed per request
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A projection is a global fit — every point's position depends on every other
point, so it cannot be computed for a viewport or a page. It is built once
against the whole matrix, written to `map_point`, and served from there. A
rebuild is triggered when the dense index changes, which is the same moment
the search ranking changes, so the map is never showing a different archive
than the search box is.

Degradation, deliberately
─────────────────────────
`moments.vec` only exists once the encoder has run (`index._embed_all`). When
there is no encoder — no GPU, no model download, a lexical-only session — the
semantic and cluster maps have nothing to project and say so. **The scatter
plot still works**, because it is pure SQL over `video_index` and needs no
embedding at all. One of the three maps is always available.

Which projection ran is reported, never hidden
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Three tiers, best available wins:

  1. **UMAP** — preserves neighbourhoods and global structure, has a real
     `transform()` so a subsample fit extends to the full set exactly.
  2. **t-SNE** — better local structure than PCA, no `transform()`, so
     out-of-sample points are placed by their nearest fitted neighbours.
  3. **PCA** — pure numpy via SVD. Always available, always fast, and honest
     about being a linear projection: it will show the big splits and blur the
     fine ones.

The tier used is stored with the map and shown in the interface, because a PCA
map and a UMAP map invite different conclusions and a viewer is entitled to
know which one they are reading.
