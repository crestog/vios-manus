"""
Channel scan and bundle import.

*"Automatically download or whatever it do all the database files uploaded in
channel, by scanning entire channel."*

The channel is the only durable tier — Kaggle's disk is wiped between sessions,
so every bundle the harvester ever exported lives there and nowhere else. This
module turns that channel back into a database.

Three things make it awkward, and each shapes the design:

**A bundle is a set of messages, not a file.** The HTTP Bot API refuses to
download anything over 20 MB, so the exporter splits at 18 MB and posts each
part as its own message. A manifest message, posted last, lists every part with
its message_id, its file_id and its SHA-256. The manifest is the commit point:
parts without one are debris from a run that died, and are ignored here.

**Bots cannot list history.** `messages.getHistory` returns BOT_METHOD_INVALID.
So the scan cannot ask "what is in this channel" — it has to walk message ids
backwards from the newest and look at each one. `tgchannel.newest_message_id()`
finds the top by posting a throwaway message and reading its id.

**The newest bundle is the one you want first.** A full backwards walk over a
channel with thousands of messages takes a while, and the whole point is a site
that is usable immediately. So there are two paths: the pinned manifest, which
the exporter pins on every successful export and which lands in one API call,
and the full scan, which runs afterwards to pick up history. The site is live
after the first one.

Import is a merge, not a restore. Every bundle is a full snapshot of the machine
at one moment; importing all of them into one database means later snapshots
overwrite rows they share and contribute rows they added, and re-importing one
changes nothing. That is what makes "scan the entire channel" safe to run twice.

**Two lanes post to this channel, and only one of them posts bundles.** The
harvester writes bundles: snapshots of the capture ledger, manifests, parts.
The GPU plane writes *shards* — `vios-evidence-*.jsonl.gz`, one gzipped JSONL
per batch of claims, each complete on its own, none of them pinned and none of
them mentioned in any manifest. Nothing about that format resembles a bundle, so
a reader that knew only manifests walked past every transcript, every caption
and every OCR line the models ever produced. `import_shard` is the other half,
and the walk offers each message to both readers.

Shards are additive where bundles are snapshots, so their merge rule is the
mirror image: never overwrite, only fill. See `_dedup_columns` and `_enrich`.

# are batches that accumulate.
#
# Atlas replays them without knowing what the GPU plane's schema is, because it
# cannot: that schema is defined in another program, on another branch of the
# tree, and changes when a pass is added. So the table shapes are inferred from
# the rows themselves. What Atlas *does* have to get right is the declared
# column types — reflect.py reads them to decide what is a timestamp and what is
# searchable text, and a table built with every column untyped reflects as one
# where nothing is a number and everything is prose.

    schema lands on its real key this way (`uid` for claims, `video_key` for
    videos, `video_key + idx` for shots) without Atlas naming any of them.

    **A key must contain an identifier.** Uniqueness alone is not evidence of a
    key, because it is measured on one batch: a shard holding one video's two
    shots has a unique `idx` — 0 and 1 — and an index built on that silently
    swallows every other video's opening shot for the rest of the archive. A
    column that is unique only because the sample was narrow is a coincidence;
    requiring the identifier is what tells the two apart.

    Empty when nothing qualifies, which is not a failure — the shard-level skip
    still holds, and a table with genuine duplicate rows should keep them.
