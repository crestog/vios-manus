"""
The moment index.

Search accuracy is decided here, not in the ranker. A ranker can only reorder
what the index gave it, so this file's job is to turn a pile of database rows
into passages that are actually retrievable.

Four decisions do most of the work:

**One table, every source.** Narratives live in Postgres, speech in one SQLite
table, OCR and object labels in another, captions in a third. Searching them
separately means merging incomparable scores later. They are copied into a
single `moments` table with a `source` tag, so ranking compares like with like
and the UI can show which kind of evidence matched.

**Short fragments are merged into passages.** A transcript row is often three
words — "yeah exactly that" — and both BM25 and a dense encoder do badly with
it: there is no context to weigh, and the vector lands nowhere useful. Adjacent
rows from the same video and source are greedily merged up to a target length,
which is why a query matches a sentence somebody said across two subtitle
segments. Long rows (a full narrative) are left alone, because they are already
passages.

**Duplicate text is collapsed.** The pipeline can emit the same narrative for a
window twice — the harvester's own schema notes call this out. Five identical
rows would win five ranks in the candidate list and crowd out real results, so
the same (video, source, text) is stored once.

**Every video gets a precomputed summary row.** `video_index` holds the title,
duration, caption, creator, poster path and per-source moment counts for each
video. Result cards need all of it, and doing those joins per query is the
difference between a 15 ms search and a 300 ms one.

Nothing here names a source table. The list comes from `reflect.text_sources()`,
so a column added upstream shows up as searchable moments on the next build.
