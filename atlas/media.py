Playback.

*"The videos should be instantly playable also as I click them... lightning fast
speed, I don't care how you achieve this logic (how cunning, smart, pre-loading,
or very optimised, better architecture)."*

The honest problem: the video is a 5–40 MB file sitting in a Telegram channel,
and fetching it takes seconds. Nothing makes that transfer instant. So the trick
is to have already done it before the click happens.

Four mechanisms, in the order they pay off:

**Local first.** If Atlas is running on the machine that harvested the reel, the
file is already on disk and `video_index.local_path` points at it. Zero network.
This is the common case on Kaggle, and it is checked before anything else.

**Speculative prefetch.** Every search response kicks off downloads for the top
few results before the person has clicked anything. By the time the eye has
travelled to the first card, the file behind it is usually resident. This is the
single biggest win, and it costs bandwidth for videos nobody opens — which is
the right trade when the alternative is a spinner on every click.

**Hover intent.** The card asks for its video on `pointerenter` and on keyboard
focus. Between deciding to click and clicking, a person spends 200–400 ms;
that is not the whole download, but it is a head start and it is free.

**Range serving.** Playback goes through a hand-written 206 responder rather
than FileResponse, because seeking in a `<video>` element requires byte ranges
and Starlette only grew range support recently. Doing it here works on every
version, and lets a partially-downloaded file serve the bytes it already has.

Eviction is LRU by access time against `VIDEO_CACHE_GB`. The cache lives on
Kaggle's scratch disk, which is wiped between sessions anyway, so nothing here
is precious — every file can be fetched again from the channel.

# CLIPS — the two-second segments that make playback instant
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# A clip is a complete, standalone, keyframe-aligned mp4 of about two seconds,
# cut at capture time and stored as its own channel message. Two things follow,
# and both are the point of the whole mechanism:
#
#   1. Playing a *moment* costs one small download, not a media session over
#      a whole reel. A 2 s clip is ~200-600 KB, which is inside the Bot API's
#      20 MB `getFile` ceiling — so it comes down over plain HTTPS with no
#      MTProto session, no sparse file, and no window arithmetic.
#   2. A frame can be extracted from a video the server has never held. The
#      clip is a real mp4, so `ffmpeg` reads it directly and `poster()` can
#      answer "the frame at 47 s" for a reel that was never downloaded.
#
# The clip is not a substitute for the full file — seeking freely and watching
# to the end still wants the whole reel, which the sparse path fetches in the
# background. Clips are what remove the wait *before* the first frame.

    One difference: a remote range is capped to `REMOTE_WINDOW`. Browsers open a
    video with `bytes=0-`, meaning "everything from here", and answering that
    literally holds one Telegram media session open for the entire file — each
    of which costs an auth handshake to build, and there are only a handful of
    permits. Returning a smaller range than asked for is explicitly allowed by
    the range spec and is what CDNs do; the player simply asks for the next
    window, by which time the background fill has usually put it on disk.
