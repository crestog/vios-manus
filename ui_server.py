# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LOG BUS — why the UI used to stall
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# This process runs TWO event loops: uvicorn owns one in a daemon thread, and
# the Ghost Worker owns the main thread's loop. WebSocket objects are created
# by uvicorn, so their transports belong to uvicorn's loop.
#
# The old code called, from the Ghost Worker's loop:
#     loop.create_task(ws_mgr.broadcast(...))
# i.e. it awaited `ws.send_json()` on transports owned by the *other* loop, once
# per log line, sequentially across every connected client. Three consequences,
# all of which the user sees as "buffering" and "getting stuck":
#
#   1. Writing to a transport from a foreign loop is undefined behaviour. It is
#      the direct source of the `socket.send() raised exception.` flood, and the
#      bare `except: pass` hid every one of them.
#   2. One WS frame per log line. A retry storm emits thousands of lines a
#      second, so the browser spent its main thread parsing JSON instead of
#      responding to clicks.
#   3. The Ghost Worker awaited that I/O, so network stalls and UI stalls fed
#      each other.
#
# The fix inverts the direction. Producers never touch a socket: they append to
# a bounded ring buffer under a plain threading.Lock (no awaits, no loop
# affinity, O(1)). Each WebSocket connection runs its own drain task ON UVICORN'S
# LOOP, keeps a cursor into the ring, and ships whatever is new as ONE batched
# frame a few times a second. Slow or dead clients can no longer back-pressure
# the harvester, and a flood costs the browser 4 frames/sec instead of 4000.

# --- FASTAPI APP ---
# Every route in this process, plus all fifty in the mounted Atlas app, is a
# sync `def`. FastAPI runs those in anyio's default worker thread pool, and that
# pool holds **40 tokens for the entire process** — one shared budget for the
# main UI, v17, admin, the process routes and Atlas together. A route that waits
# on SQLite holds its token for the whole wait (`store.py` opens with
# `timeout=30.0`), and the pages poll on blind intervals that do not wait for
# the previous answer, so a busy hour queues requests faster than they retire.
#
# A drained pool does not fail. It queues, silently, in arrival order — which is
# why the site "worked for a few tabs and nothing else" after an hour, and why
# `/atlas/atlas.js` never arrived while the cached HTML rendered instantly. The
# fault looked like broken JavaScript and was actually a full waiting room.
#
# The ceiling is a number, not a design: raise it. Threads that are parked on a
# database lock cost a stack and nothing else, and 192 of them is a few hundred
# MB of address space against a machine that is holding model weights. This is
# the floor of the fix, not the whole of it — the poll loops that fill the room
# are throttled separately, and the interface files Atlas needs to be a page at
# all are now served on the event loop so they never queue behind anything.
#
# It must run inside the loop: anyio keeps the limiter in a RunVar bound to the
# running event loop, so setting it at import time would configure a loop that
# no longer exists by the time uvicorn starts. Hence a lifespan, which is also
# the only non-deprecated place to do it.
